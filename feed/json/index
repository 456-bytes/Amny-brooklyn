However, Monday night is a huge game for Denver if they hope to keep alive their preseason playoff hopes. They can&#8217;t fall two games behind the Chargers already and feel good about making that up.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Obviously, we can&#8217;t start talking about this game without talking about how bad Russell Wilson has been this season. The veteran was a marquee acquisition for the Broncos this offseason, but he and the offense have simply fallen flat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>On the season, Wilson has completed 59% of his passes for 1,254 yards with four touchdowns and three interceptions. He&#8217;s taken 16 sacks in five games and is averaging a career-low 8.5 intended air yards per pass and 6.1 air yards per completion. Against the Colts, Wilson was 2-of-15 with two interceptions on throws of 10-plus yards. The arm strength simply isn&#8217;t there to push the ball down the field, which could be related to <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/34755364/sources-broncos-qb-russell-wilson-partially-torn-lat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reports that Wilson has been playing with a partially torn lat muscle in his throwing shoulder</a>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Even if Wilson was healthy, this offense is being poorly managed by first-year head coach Nathaniel Hackett. The playcalling has seemed confusing and misguided much of the time, and Wilson is rarely asked to throw outside of the pocket, which makes no use of his above-average mobility.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As a result, the Broncos are 31st in the NFL, averaging just 15 points per game. They also rank just 20th in rushing yards gained and 18th in yards per carry, which isn&#8217;t going to get better with Javonte Williams out for the year. The Chargers&#8217; defense has been bad against the run through five games, so the Broncos could try to establish Melvin Gordon and Mike Boone in the run game, but that doesn&#8217;t inspire a ton of confidence.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Denver is also dead last in the NFL in Red Zone conversion rate at just 21 percent% of their trips ending in touchdowns. As a team, they also lead the NFL in dropped passes. That&#8217;s not going to get you wins.\u00a0</p>\n<p>However, the Broncos do have a really solid defense. They are 3rd in the NFL, allowing just 289 yards per game, and 4th with just 16.0 points allowed per game. However, they will be without cornerback Ronald Darby, who was lost for the season last week, and pass-rusher Randy Gregory who is out this week with a knee injury. That will put a lot of pressure on Bradley Chubb.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But Denver will also blitz Justin Herbert heabvily since they are currently 4th in the NFL in blitz rate.

            "content_text": "Two AFC West rivals clash on Monday Night when the Los Angeles Chargers look to deliver a blow to the Denver Bronco&#8217;s playoff hopes.\u00a0\nDenver Broncos (2-3) at Los Angeles Chargers (3-2)\u00a0\nGame Details:\n\nLocation:\u00a0SoFi Stadium in San Inglewood, CA\nTime: Monday, October 17th at 8:15 p.m. ET\nChannel:\u00a0ESPN\n\nBetting Stats:\n\nSPREAD:\u00a0LAC -4.5\nOVER/UNDER:\u00a045.5\n\nPreview:\nIf you watched Denver&#8217;s Thursday Night Football failure against the Indianapolis Colts you&#8217;re probably thinking, &#8220;I need to watch this team in primetime again?&#8221; You&#8217;re not alone. However, Monday night is a huge game for Denver if they hope to keep alive their preseason playoff hopes. They can&#8217;t fall two games behind the Chargers already and feel good about making that up.\u00a0\nObviously, we can&#8217;t start talking about this game without talking about how bad Russell Wilson has been this season. The veteran was a marquee acquisition for the Broncos this offseason, but he and the offense have simply fallen flat.\u00a0\nOn the season, Wilson has completed 59% of his passes for 1,254 yards with four touchdowns and three interceptions. He&#8217;s taken 16 sacks in five games and is averaging a career-low 8.5 intended air yards per pass and 6.1 air yards per completion. Against the Colts, Wilson was 2-of-15 with two interceptions on throws of 10-plus yards. The arm strength simply isn&#8217;t there to push the ball down the field, which could be related to reports that Wilson has been playing with a partially torn lat muscle in his throwing shoulder.\u00a0\nEven if Wilson was healthy, this offense is being poorly managed by first-year head coach Nathaniel Hackett. The playcalling has seemed confusing and misguided much of the time, and Wilson is rarely asked to throw outside of the pocket, which makes no use of his above-average mobility.\u00a0\nAs a result, the Broncos are 31st in the NFL, averaging just 15 points per game. They also rank just 20th in rushing yards gained and 18th in yards per carry, which isn&#8217;t going to get better with Javonte Williams out for the year. The Chargers&#8217; defense has been bad against the run through five games, so the Broncos could try to establish Melvin Gordon and Mike Boone in the run game, but that doesn&#8217;t inspire a ton of confidence.\u00a0\nDenver is also dead last in the NFL in Red Zone conversion rate at just 21 percent% of their trips ending in touchdowns. As a team, they also lead the NFL in dropped passes. That&#8217;s not going to get you wins.\u00a0\nHowever, the Broncos do have a really solid defense. They are 3rd in the NFL, allowing just 289 yards per game, and 4th with just 16.0 points allowed per game. However, they will be without cornerback Ronald Darby, who was lost for the season last week, and pass-rusher Randy Gregory who is out this week with a knee injury. That will put a lot of pressure on Bradley Chubb.\u00a0\nBut Denver will also blitz Justin Herbert heabvily since they are currently 4th in the NFL in blitz rate. The problem is that Herbert has been good against extra rushers this year, completing 60% of his passes for an average of 7.8 yards per attempt, according to Pro Football Focus.\u00a0\nThe Chargers also saw their running game come alive last week with Austin Ekeler\u00a0and\u00a0Joshua Kelley combining for 222 rushing yards, 59 receiving yards, and three touchdowns in the win over Cleveland. Denver gives up 112.4 yards per game on the ground, and 135.6 yards over their last three games, so Los Angeles could look to continue getting those two guys going if they get out to an early lead on Monday.\nWhichever way you slice it, this doesn&#8217;t seem like a good matchup for Denver.\u00a0\nPicks:\n\nPlayer Props:\nAustin Ekeler over 60.5 rushing yards\nWe just covered above all the reasons that we should be hammering this prop.

Given that U.S. tensions with Venezuela meant migrants from the country could not be sent back easily, the situation became increasingly difficult to manage.</p>\n<p>So an administration that had rejected many Trump-era policies aimed at keeping out migrants, that had worked to make the asylum process easier and that had increased the number of refugees allowed into the U.S. now turned to Title 42.</p>\n<p>It brokered a deal to send the Venezuelans to Mexico, which already had agreed to accept migrants expelled under Title 42 if they are from Guatemala, Honduras or El Salvador.</p>\n<p>All the while, Justice Department lawyers continue to appeal a court decision that has kept Title 42 in place. They are opposing Republican attorneys general from more than 20 states who have argued that Title 42 is \u201cthe only safety valve preventing this Administration\u2019s already disastrous border control policies from descending into an unmitigated catastrophe.\u201d</p>\n<p>Under Title 42, migrants have been expelled more than 2.3 million times from the U.S. after crossing the country\u2019s land borders illegally from Canada or Mexico, though most try to come through Mexico.</p>\n<p>The administration had announced it would stop expelling migrants under Title 42 starting May 23 and go back to detaining and deporting migrants who did not qualify to enter and remain in the U.S. \u2014 a longer process that allows migrants to request asylum in the U.S.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are extremely disturbed by the apparent acceptance, codification, and expansion of the use of Title 42, an irrelevant health order, as a cornerstone of border policy,\u201d said Thomas Cartwright of Witness at the Border. \u201cOne that expunges the legal right to asylum.\u201d</p>\n<p>A separate lawsuit from the American Civil Liberties Union also is trying to end Title 42, an effort that could render the administration\u2019s proposal useless.</p>\n<p>\u201cPeople have a right to seek asylum \u2013 regardless of where they came from, how they arrive in the United States, and whether or not they have family here,&#8221; said ACLU lawyer Lee Gelernt.</p>\n",

(AP Photo/Elliot Spagat)\nThe administration says the policy is aimed at ensuring a \u201clawful and orderly\u201d way for Venezuelans to enter the U.S.\nWhy the turnaround?\nFor more than a year after taking office in January 2021, Biden deferred to the\u00a0Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which used its authority to keep in place the Trump-era declaration that a public health risk existed that warranted expedited expulsion of asylum-seekers.\nMembers of Biden\u2019s own party and activist groups had expressed skepticism about the public health underpinnings for allowing Title 42 to remain in effect, especially when COVID-19 was spreading more widely within the U.S. than elsewhere.\nAfter months of internal deliberations and preparations,\u00a0the CDC on April 1\u00a0said it would end the public health order and return to normal border processing of migrants, giving them a chance to request asylum in the U.S.\nHomeland Security officials braced for a resulting increase in border crossings.\nBut officials inside and outside the White House were conflicted over ending the authority, believing it effectively kept down the number of people crossing the border illegally, according to senior administration officials.\nA court order\u00a0in May that kept Title 42 in place due to a challenge from Republican state officials was greeted with quiet relief by some in the administration, according to officials who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss internal discussions.\nThe recent increase in migration from Venezuela, sparked by political, social and economic instability in the country, dashed officials\u2019 hopes that they were finally seeing a lull in the chaos that had defined the border region for the past year.\nBy August, Venezuelans were the second-largest nationality arriving at the U.S. border after Mexicans. Given that U.S. tensions with Venezuela meant migrants from the country could not be sent back easily, the situation became increasingly difficult to manage.\nSo an administration that had rejected many Trump-era policies aimed at keeping out migrants, that had worked to make the asylum process easier and that had increased the number of refugees allowed into the U.S. now turned to Title 42.\nIt brokered a deal to send the Venezuelans to Mexico, which already had agreed to accept migrants expelled under Title 42 if they are from Guatemala, Honduras or El Salvador.\nAll the while, Justice Department lawyers continue to appeal a court decision that has kept Title 42 in place. They are opposing Republican attorneys general from more than 20 states who have argued that Title 42 is \u201cthe only safety valve preventing this Administration\u2019s already disastrous border control policies from descending into an unmitigated catastrophe.\u201d\nUnder Title 42, migrants have been expelled more than 2.3 million times from the U.S. after crossing the country\u2019s land borders illegally from Canada or Mexico, though most try to come through Mexico.\nThe administration had announced it would stop expelling migrants under Title 42 starting May 23 and go back to detaining and deporting migrants who did not qualify to enter and remain in the U.S. \u2014 a longer process that allows migrants to request asylum in the U.S.\n\u201cWe are extremely disturbed by the apparent acceptance, codification, and expansion of the use of Title 42, an irrelevant health order, as a cornerstone of border policy,\u201d said Thomas Cartwright of Witness at the Border. \u201cOne that expunges the legal right to asylum.\u201d\nA separate lawsuit from the American Civil Liberties Union also is trying to end Title 42, an effort that could render the administration\u2019s proposal useless.\n\u201cPeople have a right to seek asylum \u2013 regardless of where they came from, how they arrive in the United States, and whether or not they have family here,&#8221; said ACLU lawyer Lee Gelernt.",
